# Project Euler Solutions #

This repository contains my solutions to various [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problems) problems in multiple languages.

I will be trying to post solutions simultaneously in Java (8), Scala and Haskell, though my proficieny in them is greatly varied. This will reflect on the quality of the implementation as well. If you see my solution and think a better one in the language exists, please do let me know.

In the future, I will also be trying to add solutions in other languages as I learn them.
